back to point
final solution shoukd consider all these redudancies and worst case
what im suggesting is
just for calculation of estimating storage
we go with the simpler model
first
not 4 variables
You
12:14 AM
a single variable
r, denoting the rate at which vaccines are being transported
You
12:16 AM
like
this district requires 15000 units per month
vials
 or doses whatever
okay
vials
given workforce 
You
12:17 AM
we can measure the requirement at thc level
yes
and put a graph
of requirement vs workforce
like more workforce we can process vials
hence that thc will request more vials
You
12:18 AM
cool
so we know the requirement at bottomost level
from that we can calculate requirement at next level
in "design condn" where we dont need to bypass
You
12:19 AM
as in district directly asking satte
ignore prev msg
essentiall
we can build the levels up top manner
and get requiremnts at each level
yes
bottom up*
You
12:20 AM
so we know R at each level ?
now, R = F_d * V_d
1. first calculate r at each level
You
12:21 AM
2. modify F-d  and V_d at each level separately
to optimize cose
cost*
with contraint, F_d*V_d = r
okay va ?
You
12:23 AM
next
we have F_d V-d at each level
no infra cost considered here
only transport cost
You
12:24 AM
since its a variable cost
and adds up over time
so after step 1 and step 2
we have f_d and V-d at each level
we used the regression formula to calculate storage capacity at each level
You
12:25 AM
yes
so now we have storage Capacity
we can multiply it for a safety factor 1.5 just to be sure it can handle all volumes
and then ;like u told
we find all fixed costs
You
12:26 AM
cool
1.2
essentially some safety factor
with this 2 step approach
we can estimate all values
3 step approach*
You
12:27 AM
changing n
yes
that will directly affect workforce
and that will directly affect everything
yes
next
this approach looks cool la ?
You
12:28 AM
yes
but starting with storage was a bit messed up* and we all got confused
pardon last point
didnt hear properly
yeah
You
12:29 AM
this also include chinami's village level of abstraction
geographic disparity also comes in transport function
makes sense
You
12:30 AM
cool
next step is to verify whether we have all data to carry out this 3 step process
population density
peace
then transportation cost
You
12:32 AM
as function of (location, mode, F_s, V_s)
it wiill depend no
yes
the location and mod eparameter will vary geographically
You
12:33 AM
yes
also mayve a coefficient 
like 1.1 at hilly places
then for step 3 regression formula
we need actual eq
You
12:34 AM
yeah
who is doing what now tmmrw
peace
cool
You
12:36 AM
just b4 lunch
1 hour to dicuss
lunch break
then immediatley after that we sit together and start
yes
this takes care of logistics
You
12:37 AM
monitoring ?
we can include a wastage coefficient also ?
